<h1>The colour of hope</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Sometimes a muse just comes in the post …</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Hope is a snowdrop nosing through grit<br />
White tipped greenness,<br />
Stained with the earthen truth of it.</p><br />
<br />
If hope had a colour<br />
It would be a rainbow’s hue; <br />
Fused as a singularity.</p><br />
<br />
If hope had a colour <br />
It would be justly true;<br />
Mitigating life’s duality.</p><br />
<br />
Hope is the colour of you.</p><br />
<br />
