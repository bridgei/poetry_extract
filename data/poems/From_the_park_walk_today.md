# From the park walk today …  
> The past few days’ storms brought almost constant rain. Now, after the dawn’s drizzle, the sun is shining. I set off following the dog onto the familiar path through the local park land.   

Already I can see damage to more than a few trees, even some fallen ones. Ahead a young beech tree has succumbed to the weight of the rains. Broken, it lies across the path. A fledgling blackbird sits on the gravel amidst broken branches, basking in a pool of morning sunlight. We walk around, dog and I.  
  
Felled tree  
Roosting spot no more —  
Only rain  
  
Meadow grass  
White clover sprinkles  
Dew glistens  
  
Woodland glade’s sunbeams  
Hopping blackbird stops, listens —  
Raindrops pattering
