<h1>In the grinder</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Just there are ordinary, mundane, days when just getting to bedtime is a win of sorts.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>I was meant to be a hermit<br />
Solitary; shunned-and-shunning strife<br />
Living where I could<br />
Wandering where I would<br />
Instincitvely dodging life<br />
The abrasive rawness of â€¦ it.</p><br />
<br />
