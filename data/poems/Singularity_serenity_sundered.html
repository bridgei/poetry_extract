<h1>Singularity, serenity, sundered!</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>With a nod to Buddha and Darryl Reanney â€” from stardust of a singularity we are born; quantum entanglement binds us.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>I remember singularity<br />
We were one, complete<br />
You and I and them</p><br />
<br />
I recall serenity<br />
We were calm, content<br />
You and I and them</p><br />
<br />
I recollect separation<br />
We were rent, sundered<br />
You and I and them</p><br />
<br />
I realise sorrow<br />
We were many, apart<br />
You and I and them</p><br />
<br />
I endure separation<br />
We were split, adrift<br />
You and I and them.</p><br />
<br />
I suffer solitude<br />
We are lost, seeking<br />
You for I for them.</p><br />
<br />
Singularity, serenity, sundered!<br />
We grope still in darkness<br />
You for I for them<br />
</p><br />
<br />
