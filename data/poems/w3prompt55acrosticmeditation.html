<p>In response to the prompt to write an acrostic —I had to look it up too— verse based on one of these words: Discipline; Enthusiasm; Meditation; Tumult; Trouble.</p><br />

</p>Meditation acrostic</p><br />
<br />
Mind runs on ahead<br />
Eager to greet new experience<br />
Determined to find meaning<br />
Intent on solving the mystery.<br />
Troubled it turns inward<br />
Anxiously replaying, rewriting, editing.<br />
The body is.<br />
In time mind tires, falls still.<br />
Only awareness flitters.<br />
Now breath comes, now breath goes.</p><br />
<br />
