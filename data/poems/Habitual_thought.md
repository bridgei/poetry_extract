Reaching up I see you  
Trapped upon life’s edge  
Anchored in mundanity.  
I try to coax you down here  
To awaken to the freedom of reality.  
I see you looking down in fear  
Hand reaching down to mine  
Longing —yet unable—  
To take that final step  
Beyond doubt  
Into the uncertainty of existence.
