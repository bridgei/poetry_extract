# Woodland mood  

This woodland walk   
Its sleepy rhythm  
Paced by sunbeams  
Lapping against the trunks   
Of gently passing trees  
  
Dappled shade punctuates  
Emphasising this tree or that   
Indifferent and ever-changing  
Just as mind —seeking action—   
Endlessly purveys baseless thoughts  
  
The sound of the breeze in the canopy    
A reminder always  
Of that whisper of silence  
That pervades all  
Soothing this troubled heart
