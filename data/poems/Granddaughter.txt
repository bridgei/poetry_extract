Granddaughter
> Somethings in life are so beautiful, so precious, so damn joyous, that they come out the other side as agonisingly painful. Or maybe that’s just me. I cry.

Granddaughter

You light my life 
Your laugh your smile 
Hugs at night and anytime
There was a time I felt
That I’d loved all I would
But now I know that sweetest joy
Of finding your long lost toy
Asleep inside my old shoe
You lovely rascal you.

It breaks my heart this life
Sadness stalks each sweet moment
Your innocence runs before you
Across the playground shrieking in glee
Friends in all directions flee
Hiding now in joyful play
My heart yearns for it to stay this way
For your life to be an endless rainbow
A miasmic blur of unicorns and fairy tales
Yet I know
It cannot be so

Into your life pain will creep
Just as it does with each of us
Scarring often far to deep
Leaving us wishing for how it was
And ever it will be so
Sadness stalking from the shadows
Even now as evening draws
Sadness sits with me and jaws
That one day I will not be
The one to pick you up and rub your knee

Even this love I feel cuts so sharp
It dawns on me now that sometime 
As we walk our paths must diverge
There will be a time my child
When I cannot walk with you 
Nor run nor push your swing
Nor whizz you down life’s slide
This sadness sits sipping tea
It is a lovely thing
The shadow side of loving deep
The laughter that comes before the sleep
