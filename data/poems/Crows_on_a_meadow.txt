Crows on a meadow

This dawn stroll
The tree line 
Fringing open fields

These standing crows
Sleek black jackets
Glistening in soft morning rays

The great birds slow-step 
Like mendicant monks
Bowed over their dana bowls

Patient in vigilant thusness 
Crowness awaits the flicker of movement
That signals breakfastâ€™s arrival
