<h1>Morning heron</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Another note from my morning park walk with my dog Lola. We were pleased to note the local grey heron once more this morning.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Nearing the lake, this early walk is ending.<br />
The grey heron —glimpsed through the bushes in the gloomy dawn light earlier— is on the far shoreline now.<br />
With slow sure-footed strides and steady gaze it prowls; serenely searching sustenance.<br />
I peer across waters painted dazzling gold by rays of this low September sun.<br />
Shading my eyes I pause to watch.<br />
So too, the heron.<br />
Two ducks in its eyeshot scramble to shore.<br />
It turns its head to me.<br />
We see.<br />
For an eternal moment, we stand looking one at another, then —with a mental gassho to unity— suchness continues.</p><br />
<br />
Morning heron prowls<br />
Slow-striding this lake’s shoreline—<br />
Pausing we see thus</p><br />
<br />
