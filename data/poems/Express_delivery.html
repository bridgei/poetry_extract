<h1>Express delivery</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Challenging perspective â€¦</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>the ironic tragedy of time travel is not that it is unattainable;<br />
rather that it is unavoidable.</p><br />
<br />
as from a train pulling slowly from the station,<br />
we sit powerless and transfixed;<br />
gazing through smeared windows<br />
watching all that we knew dwindle into insigniificance</p><br />
<br />
<br />
