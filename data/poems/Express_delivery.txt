Express delivery
Challenging perspective â€¦


the ironic tragedy of time travel is not that it is unattainable;
rather that it is unavoidable.

as from a train pulling slowly from the station,
we sit powerless and transfixed;
gazing through smeared windows
watching all that we knew dwindle into insigniificance
