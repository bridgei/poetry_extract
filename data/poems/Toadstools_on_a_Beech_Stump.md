# Toadstools on a Beech Stump  
> Sometimes a walk in the woods is more than just a walk …  
Distant crows  
Tumbling skyward   
Morning joy  
  
Two leaves  
Spiralling earthward  
Journeys end  
  
Old tree stump  
Fungi sprouting wild   
Life’s circle  
  
This season  
Ushers somber change  
Nurtures hope  
  
Path stretches  
Beckoning this heart  
Tales unfold …
