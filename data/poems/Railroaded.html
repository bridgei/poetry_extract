<h1>Railroaded</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Sitting in the garden. I’m surrounded not by the usual sound of nature; thrush, robins and blackbird song. No today it is the sound of chain saw and shredder as contractors clear the green corridor that was. They need to shore-up the railroad’s cutting. </p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Coming for the trees</p><br />
<br />
 Today sadness settled in<br />
Today they came for the trees<br />
They came with chainsaws and shredders<br />
With good intentions; environmental measures<br />
Good workers, with families and babies to feed<br />
Corporations with plans and projects and pressures<br />
Lawyers, liabilities and profit and greed</p><br />
<br />
They came for the trees<br />
So the trains could run<br />
So the houses don’t slip <br />
Down into the dip; the cutting they built..<br />
I felt the screams inside<br />
They bit me deep; so I cried; <br />
Perhaps its love … or is it guilt?</p><br />
<br />
The hawthorn, blackthorn and maple and hornbeam<br />
I planted them all; that whole hedgerow <br />
A thirty-metre strip, where life could just sit.<br />
A squirrel highway<br />
Birds love(d) it; raise(d) chicks in it<br />
Today is a sad day<br />
Today they came for the trees</p><br />
<br />
