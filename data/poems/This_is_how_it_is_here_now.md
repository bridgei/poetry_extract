# This is how it is here now …  
> This poem —if such it is— is but a glimpse inside that mind-trap …   
The heart is a gentle, altogether more tranquil place; my head is one of the hell realms, I’m sure. I get trapped in there at times; whole weekends pass like this.   
I am slowly learning to live from the heart not the mind; but it is a two-steps forward, one-step back stagger.   


Mired in maudlin mindfulness  
Mind casts attention back  
Observes —unerringly, incessantly—  
The pockmarked landscape  
That ancient path  
Once straight, yet  
Crooked now   
Where ghosts of past loves  
Lie simply marked  
By scars upon the heart  
Deep gouts of pain  
Lie buried there  
Stifled in un-cried tears  
Sorrow their signpost  
  
Mired in maudlin mindfulness  
Mind draws attention back  
Reveals —remorselessly, unceasingly—  
The half-picked scabs  
Of weeping wounds  
Tests the arrows’ heft  
Tracks trajectories’ artful arcs  
Feels piercing pain —anew—  
For each and every wound  
Slowly salving with  
Searing awareness  
Cauterising with compassion   
Zazen —for such it is— reveals  
This is how it is here now!
