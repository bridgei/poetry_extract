<h1>Masked men</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>It was all so very civilised. Picking you up and driving you to the hospital. A little polite chatter here and there. Then off you went with the nurse to settle-in. I recall I sat outside the reception in the cool air for a few minutes; collecting thoughts before getting on with the day. If only we’d both known … what might we have done? </p><br />
<p>It would be my father’s birthday today; were he still here. I miss him these past twelve years still; I suppose I always will.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>We wore our usual faces<br />
The last time we spoke<br />
Masks of convenience<br />
With emotions that never broke.</p><br />
<br />
I didn’t want to alarm you<br />
You wanted not to worry me<br />
We wore those blank masks<br />
And spoke about mundanity.</p><br />
<br />
When I saw you next — gasping<br />
All wired up and plumbed-in<br />
The oxygen mask gripped tight<br />
I knew we’d never speak again.</p><br />
<br />
We wore our usual faces<br />
The last time we spoke<br />
Knowing what those masks blanked<br />
How much our hearts broke.</p><br />
<br />
I miss you dad<br />
Just as I knew I would<br />
But hid to spare you pain<br />
Hear me now! I wish you could.</p><br />
<br />
Decades pass<br />
Sat here alone I sob<br />
And set aside my mask —<br />
For all your happy birthdays lost.</p><br />
<br />
