<h1>Shadow life</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Shadow-free…</p><br />
<p>It’s really weird where the mind goes sometimes; I wish I didn’t always have to follow it so.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>What if a shadow longed to be free,<br />
Just to be whatever it could be?<br />
What if it yearned and strove,<br />
To become something someone could love?<br />
What if it found a way to fight,<br />
The ties that bind it tight?</p><br />
<br />
What if your shadow broke free?<br />
And what if that shadow were me?<br />
Now I can do whatever I want<br />
Run, dance, laugh,cry; ah … but I don’t.<br />
Now that I can do,<br />
It seems I don’t know what to.</p><br />
<br />
Now I’m a shadow so free<br />
I can see what I never could see.<br />
Who knew that in freedom I’d find<br />
That those ties, they didn’t bind.<br />
I was a shadow following you, <br />
But now … what is it I’m supposed to do?</p><br />
<br />
What if I, free and loose<br />
Suddenly had a purpose in life to choose?<br />
Of course I’d be kind, and loving too;<br />
But after that … what is there to do?<br />
So this shadow I, sits and it ponders<br />
What is life about it wonders.</p><br />
<br />
So, life; is it to be happy? Or,<br />
Just to endure?<br />
Maybe to worship something somewhere.<br />
To be truly invested in whatever you care<br />
Or is life’s mystery just, a vacation from death?<br />
Maybe that’s why the only rhyme here is breath?</p><br />
<br />
So shadow I still sits best,<br />
Here on the wall, by the chair where you rest.<br />
It ponders life’s mystery in mind<br />
And we both wonder what will it find.<br />
And will we find it following our breath<br />
When we rise from our short vacation from death?</p><br />
<br />
Just be.<br />
Feel, Love, Care; live.<br />
</p><br />
<br />
