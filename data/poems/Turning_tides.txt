Turning tides …
> My morning walk is a nagging reminder of the impermanence of all things, of nature’s ceaseless appetite for change.

The tide is turning
This ancient wood knows it
Feels it deep in its heart
It shows it
Trees bathing lazily
Basking longingly as
Morning’s soft gold light
Drapes their mighty boughs
Cascades through the canopy
Revealing nature’s ceaseless march

The tide is turning
These grey squirrels know it
Scent it on the breeze
They show it 
In their darting scurries
In their tireless searching
In their deft steps
In each new nut stashed

The tide is turning
This old path knows it
Here right under foot
It shows it
Beech nuts crunch
Acorns scatter
Fallen leaves of yellow, tan and brown
Settle into sleep

The tide is turning
This old fool knows it too
Sensing a gentler beat
Halting footsteps show it
The journey slowing
The days shortening 
The light dimming 
Conditions changing

The tide is turning
As it always will
The wood
The squirrells
The path
The fool
Each travel their journey
Refreshed each moment
In new garb
Reliant one upon another
