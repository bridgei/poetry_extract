<h1>Placeholder for Compassion</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Words are pale imitations of experience; of suchness. Do not be fooled by relying upon them.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>My words are empty.<br />
They leave you suffering,<br />
Though I am here.<br />
Words, a poor substitute,<br />
A proxy compassion;<br />
For my leaving you.<br />
For my wandering this land<br />
Seeking berries and herbs.<br />
Returning to you always;<br />
Tending your wounds, with natureâ€™s salves.</p><br />
<br />
My words are empty.<br />
They leave me suffering,<br />
Now you are gone.<br />
Words, a pale imitation,<br />
A proxy remorse;<br />
For my leaving you.<br />
For my wandering this mind<br />
Seeking truths and justices.<br />
Returning to you briefly;<br />
Tending your wounds with empty concepts.</p><br />
<br />
