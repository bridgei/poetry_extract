<br />
<h1>Now waning, now waxing</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Just a note from a short midwinter stroll.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Darkness reigns<br />
Shrouds this dawn walk<br />
Crisp crescent moon<br />
Accompanies this bright morning star<br />
Startled Robinâ€™s song<br />
Splits this stillness</p><br />
<br />
Frost rimed holly leaves<br />
Glossy on this tree<br />
The crunch of frosted leaves<br />
Beneath these feet<br />
The caw of that distant crow<br />
These things lift this heart</p><br />
<br />
This everchanging journey <br />
Its uncertain path fraught <br />
Resolves in each such moment<br />
As peace, joy and love<br />
Only be here<br />
And this you will know </p><br />
<br />
<br />
