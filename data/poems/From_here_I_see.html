<h1>From here I see …</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Beggars’ End</p><br />
<p>Homelessness is being — or has been depending on when you read this— criminalised by the Conservative government, spurred on by an increasingly right-wing leaning society. Where does that road lead?</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>From here I can see the rainbow <br />
A trickle of pigeon coloured ribbons <br />
A swirling entwining enthralling show<br />
Until suddenly they are gone; <br />
Plunging down to the storm drain <br />
Diesel-discharge writhing in this early shower-fall.</p><br />
<br />
From here I can see the normals <br />
A stream of brightly colored bobbins <br />
A jostling barging mewling herd <br />
Until suddenly they are gone <br />
Plunging down to the subway train <br />
Commuting cattle chaffing in this early shower-fall.</p><br />
<br />
From here I watch the life<br />
Turning ever grey<br />
Draining from the day <br />
From here I watch the time <br />
Passing by and by <br />
Noting every sigh</p><br />
<br />
From here today I venture not <br />
Nor ever more shall stray <br />
The cardboard pire that covers me <br />
Sodden to the bone <br />
The mind that bore such loves and dreams <br />
Stilled now by guttered streams <br />
Of snot and puke and phlegm</p><br />
<br />
From here I reek <br />
My scent attracting dogs <br />
Soon the hardened many will stop and stare <br />
At the wretched beggar lying there <br />
Yet a few will see amongst the tattered rags <br />
A fellow soul fallen hard.<br />
</p><br />
<br />
