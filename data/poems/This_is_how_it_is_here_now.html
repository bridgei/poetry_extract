<h1>This is how it is here now …</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>This poem —if such it is— is but a glimpse inside that mind-trap … </p><br />
<p>The heart is a gentle, altogether more tranquil place; my head is one of the hell realms, I’m sure. I get trapped in there at times; whole weekends pass like this. </p><br />
<p>I am slowly learning to live from the heart not the mind; but it is a two-steps forward, one-step back stagger. </p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Mired in maudlin mindfulness<br />
Mind casts attention back<br />
Observes —unerringly, incessantly—<br />
The pockmarked landscape<br />
That ancient path<br />
Once straight, yet<br />
Crooked now <br />
Where ghosts of past loves<br />
Lie simply marked<br />
By scars upon the heart<br />
Deep gouts of pain<br />
Lie buried there<br />
Stifled in un-cried tears<br />
Sorrow their signpost</p><br />
<br />
Mired in maudlin mindfulness<br />
Mind draws attention back<br />
Reveals —remorselessly, unceasingly—<br />
The half-picked scabs<br />
Of weeping wounds<br />
Tests the arrows’ heft<br />
Tracks trajectories’ artful arcs<br />
Feels piercing pain —anew—<br />
For each and every wound<br />
Slowly salving with<br />
Searing awareness<br />
Cauterising with compassion <br />
Zazen —for such it is— reveals<br />
This is how it is here now!</p><br />
<br />
