Shadow life
> Shadow-free…
> It’s really weird where the mind goes sometimes; I wish I didn’t always have to follow it so.

What if a shadow longed to be free,
Just to be whatever it could be?
What if it yearned and strove,
To become something someone could love?
What if it found a way to fight,
The ties that bind it tight?

What if your shadow broke free?
And what if that shadow were me?
Now I can do whatever I want
Run, dance, laugh,cry; ah … but I don’t.
Now that I can do,
It seems I don’t know what to.

Now I’m a shadow so free
I can see what I never could see.
Who knew that in freedom I’d find
That those ties, they didn’t bind.
I was a shadow following you, 
But now … what is it I’m supposed to do?

What if I, free and loose
Suddenly had a purpose in life to choose?
Of course I’d be kind, and loving too;
But after that … what is there to do?
So this shadow I, sits and it ponders
What is life about it wonders.

So, life; is it to be happy? Or,
Just to endure?
Maybe to worship something somewhere.
To be truly invested in whatever you care
Or is life’s mystery just, a vacation from death?
Maybe that’s why the only rhyme here is breath?

So shadow I still sits best,
Here on the wall, by the chair where you rest.
It ponders life’s mystery in mind
And we both wonder what will it find.
And will we find it following our breath
When we rise from our short vacation from death?

Just be.
Feel, Love, Care; live.
