This man grows away
From the child he was.
Once —he knows— 
He sat beside his young sister
Upon the shiny black vinyl sofa
In grandma’s lounge.
Its bright orange brinylon cushions
Soft and furry against the skin.

Patiently they both waited 
As ‘mother set out a rainbow
On the old picnic table.
Its pocked blue Formica top
Presented a glorious canvass.
The orangeness of baked beans
With creamy coloured chips
White buttered bread.

The man sighs at the memory:
‘mother’s permed silvered hair;
Sister’s blond pigtails;
Salt-sweet aroma of their steamy lunch.
The boy savours those beans.
Juice drops downs his chin,
How his sister used-to grin;
Goofy gap-toothed .

The man weeps at their loss;
The passing of it all.
The stark loneliness,
Of unshareable memories.
The boy eats on,
Unaware all else is gone.
Nothing remains; no-one but he,
And this single savoury memory.
