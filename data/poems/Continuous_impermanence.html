<h1>Continuous impermanence</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Practise Path</p><br />
<p>When a boat leaves the water, there is no hole left behind; so our footsteps leave no trace. Pass this way lightly, with love, as if you will never see it again,</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>This is my practice.<br />
Each day I try to walk this path,<br />
As if it is the last time I will.<br />
Iâ€™ve known it for thirty years<br />
Like an old friend it delights me<br />
As if it were the first time, still.</p><br />
<br />
This is my practise<br />
Each moment I walk this path<br />
I seek to do so as if it were my last.<br />
Yet each time mind falters<br />
The path, or life, defeats me<br />
But one day this practice will be past.<br />
</p><br />
