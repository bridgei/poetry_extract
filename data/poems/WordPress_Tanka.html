<h1>WordPress Tanka</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Dana is the Sanskrit word for generosity. The Dana bowl was held-out by itinerant monks seeking alms</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Oh, these Like buttons<br />
Virtual comfort blankets<br />
For the poetsâ€™ soul</p><br />
<br />
Digital Dana bowl rests<br />
Seeking clicks as nourishment</p><br />
<br />
