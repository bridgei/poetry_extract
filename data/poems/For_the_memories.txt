For the memories …
> Autumn has the haunting ability to remind us of impermanence

September sun
Sweeter yet for the passing
Of this feeble summer
And the looming
Of nature’s uncertain winter.September sun
Sweeter yet for the passing
Of this wasted youth
And the looming
Of nature’s uncertain winter.September sun
Warming these bones
One more time
Before the looming
Of nature’s certain prize.
