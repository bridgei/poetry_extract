<h1>Turning tides …</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>My morning walk is a nagging reminder of the impermanence of all things, of nature’s ceaseless appetite for change.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>The tide is turning<br />
This ancient wood knows it<br />
Feels it deep in its heart<br />
It shows it<br />
Trees bathing lazily<br />
Basking longingly as<br />
Morning’s soft gold light<br />
Drapes their mighty boughs<br />
Cascades through the canopy<br />
Revealing nature’s ceaseless march</p><br />
<br />
The tide is turning<br />
These grey squirrels know it<br />
Scent it on the breeze<br />
They show it <br />
In their darting scurries<br />
In their tireless searching<br />
In their deft steps<br />
In each new nut stashed</p><br />
<br />
The tide is turning<br />
This old path knows it<br />
Here right under foot<br />
It shows it<br />
Beech nuts crunch<br />
Acorns scatter<br />
Fallen leaves of yellow, tan and brown<br />
Settle into sleep</p><br />
<br />
The tide is turning<br />
This old fool knows it too<br />
Sensing a gentler beat<br />
Halting footsteps show it<br />
The journey slowing<br />
The days shortening <br />
The light dimming <br />
Conditions changing</p><br />
<br />
The tide is turning<br />
As it always will<br />
The wood<br />
The squirrells<br />
The path<br />
The fool<br />
Each travel their journey<br />
Refreshed each moment<br />
In new garb<br />
Reliant one upon another <br />
</p><br />
<br />
