<h1>More then a Feeling</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Love is not a feeling….</p><br />
<p>Marie Howe (After the Movie)</p><br />
<p>This poem is inspired by a line in a Marie Howe poem titled After the Movie</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>What if love was just a feeling?<br />
Just a little emotion to brighten the night.<br />
What if love was just a feeling?<br />
But it’s more than that —you know that; right?</p><br />
<br />
If love was just a feeling<br />
You could up and walk away.<br />
If love was just a feeling<br />
What would there be … to make you stay?</p><br />
<br />
But, what-if love was just a feeling …<br />
When you’d been and had your way<br />
When that feeling waned and ebbed inside<br />
Would you leave, or would you stay?</p><br />
<br />
How could love be just a feeling?<br />
When it burns inside so fierce.<br />
When its light puts solitude to flight<br />
And universe touches universe.</p><br />
<br />
So no, love is not a feeling.<br />
Love … is an imperative!<br />
An innate compulsion;<br />
To sustain, to thrive.</p><br />
<br />
Love is a life-force;<br />
Strong as the will-to-live.<br />
Shareable, transferable; <br />
It is the gift we cannot not give.</p><br />
<br />
Love is the bridge<br />
Spanning minds, profound connection.<br />
Transforming, inspiring;<br />
Singularity’s completion.</p><br />
<br />
Love is.<br />
JFDI!</p><br />
