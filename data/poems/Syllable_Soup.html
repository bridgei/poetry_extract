<h1>Syllable Soup  â€¦</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Sometimes we need to set aside words and touch that which is real; with all our senses. No labels, no lies, no incompleteness. Just what is..</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Syllables fall, softly settling<br />
As does snow on an old oak tree<br />
Smothering all beneath them<br />
Blanketing beauty<br />
Masking misery<br />
Distorting and distracting</p><br />
<br />
Words form paragraphs join chapters<br />
New worlds are born<br />
Coalescing from the morass<br />
A new reality<br />
Bigger better bolder brasher<br />
Buy it, read it, see it, watch it; upgrade it</p><br />
<br />
Beneath it all lies what is<br />
The mother and father of all words<br />
That which needs no words<br />
Such is this existence<br />
Wordless it is real<br />
Eternal Suchness</p><br />
<br />
<br />
