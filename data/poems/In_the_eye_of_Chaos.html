<h1>In the eye of Chaos</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>How does it feel to sit in the midst of a mental maelstrom?</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Stillness rarely falls<br />
In this turbulent storm<br />
I snatch at passing squalls<br />
Deciphering their truculent form<br />
Teasing out their words<br />
In whispers barely heard.Silence rarely falls.<br />
In this incessant gale<br />
I grasp at half-heard calls;<br />
Rendering their stinging tale<br />
Teasing out their words<br />
In whispers barely heard.Joy barely registers<br />
In this tempest keening <br />
I cling to swirling non sequiturs<br />
Devining their twisted meaning <br />
Teasing out their words<br />
In whispers barely heard.In the eye of the storm is calm;<br />
The still silent howl of despair,<br />
And I yet waiting there.</p><br />
<br />
