From here I see …
Beggars’ End
Homelessness is being — or has been depending on when you read this— criminalised by the Conservative government, spurred on by an increasingly right-wing leaning society. Where does that road lead?


From here I can see the rainbow 
A trickle of pigeon coloured ribbons 
A swirling entwining enthralling show
Until suddenly they are gone; 
Plunging down to the storm drain 
Diesel-discharge writhing in this early shower-fall.

From here I can see the normals 
A stream of brightly colored bobbins 
A jostling barging mewling herd 
Until suddenly they are gone 
Plunging down to the subway train 
Commuting cattle chaffing in this early shower-fall.

From here I watch the life
Turning ever grey
Draining from the day 
From here I watch the time 
Passing by and by 
Noting every sigh

From here today I venture not 
Nor ever more shall stray 
The cardboard pire that covers me 
Sodden to the bone 
The mind that bore such loves and dreams 
Stilled now by guttered streams 
Of snot and puke and phlegm

From here I reek 
My scent attracting dogs 
Soon the hardened many will stop and stare 
At the wretched beggar lying there 
Yet a few will see amongst the tattered rags 
A fellow soul fallen hard.
