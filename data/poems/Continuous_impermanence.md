# Continuous impermanence  
> Practise Path  
When a boat leaves the water, there is no hole left behind; so our footsteps leave no trace. Pass this way lightly, with love, as if you will never see it again,  


This is my practice.  
Each day I try to walk this path,  
As if it is the last time I will.  
Iâ€™ve known it for thirty years  
Like an old friend it delights me  
As if it were the first time, still.  
  
This is my practise  
Each moment I walk this path  
I seek to do so as if it were my last.  
Yet each time mind falters  
The path, or life, defeats me  
But one day this practice will be past.
