Morning heron
Another note from my morning park walk with my dog Lola. We were pleased to note the local grey heron once more this morning.


Nearing the lake, this early walk is ending.
The grey heron —glimpsed through the bushes in the gloomy dawn light earlier— is on the far shoreline now.
With slow sure-footed strides and steady gaze it prowls; serenely searching sustenance.
I peer across waters painted dazzling gold by rays of this low September sun.
Shading my eyes I pause to watch.
So too, the heron.
Two ducks in its eyeshot scramble to shore.
It turns its head to me.
We see.
For an eternal moment, we stand looking one at another, then —with a mental gassho to unity— suchness continues.

Morning heron prowls
Slow-striding this lake’s shoreline—
Pausing we see thus
