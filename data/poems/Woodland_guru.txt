Woodland guru
> Just a walk in the park. A ball a dog an old fool.

In the woods
My guru trots ahead
All four legs pottering in mindful harmony.

She tests me
Leaves her squeaky toy
Amongst the slender bluebells there.

She hides then
The better to see me
Peeking around the aged oak tree.

In the woods
My guru watches
Mindfully I deploy my ninja skills.

I approach the toy
Slipping between
Fragile fragrant bluebells.
Stepping over 
Embryonic trees; 
Miniatures, not yet saplings,
They scatter the woodland clearing here.
Tender shoots, basking in the sunlight
Cascading through the canopy gap,
Left by a long passed ancestor,
Remembered now only 
By its rotting stump and boughs
A habitat for multitudes.

Bending low
Midst the nettles now
I grasp guru’s squeaky toy; the prize.

I bow to guru —triumphant— only to see
Just a tree; guruless;
She is gone; hiding elsewhere; somewhere.

The lesson continues.
The proto-saplings nod their gratitude
And bluebells smell as bluebells do.
My footsteps leave no trace.
Gassho to the guru, to the woods.

In the woods
My guru trots ahead
All four legs pottering in mindful harmony.
