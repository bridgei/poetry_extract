<h1>Children grow so far away</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>This man grows away From the child he was …</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>This man grows away<br />
From the child he was.<br />
Once —he knows— <br />
He sat beside his young sister<br />
Upon the shiny black vinyl sofa<br />
In grandma’s lounge.<br />
Its bright orange brinylon cushions<br />
Soft and furry against the skin.</p><br />
<br />
Patiently they both waited <br />
As ‘mother set out a rainbow<br />
On the old picnic table.<br />
Its pocked blue Formica top<br />
Presented a glorious canvass.<br />
The orangeness of baked beans<br />
With creamy coloured chips<br />
White buttered bread.</p><br />
<br />
The man sighs at the memory:<br />
‘mother’s permed silvered hair;<br />
Sister’s blond pigtails;<br />
Salt-sweet aroma of their steamy lunch.<br />
The boy savours those beans.<br />
Juice drops downs his chin,<br />
How his sister used-to grin;<br />
Goofy gap-toothed .</p><br />
<br />
The man weeps at their loss;<br />
The passing of it all.<br />
The stark loneliness,<br />
Of unshareable memories.<br />
The boy eats on,<br />
Unaware all else is gone.<br />
Nothing remains; no-one but he,<br />
And this single savoury memory.<br />
</p><br />
<br />
