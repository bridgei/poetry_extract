# Masked men  
> It was all so very civilised. Picking you up and driving you to the hospital. A little polite chatter here and there. Then off you went with the nurse to settle-in. I recall I sat outside the reception in the cool air for a few minutes; collecting thoughts before getting on with the day. If only we’d both known … what might we have done?   
It would be my father’s birthday today; were he still here. I miss him these past twelve years still; I suppose I always will.  


We wore our usual faces  
The last time we spoke  
Masks of convenience  
With emotions that never broke.  
  
I didn’t want to alarm you  
You wanted not to worry me  
We wore those blank masks  
And spoke about mundanity.  
  
When I saw you next — gasping  
All wired up and plumbed-in  
The oxygen mask gripped tight  
I knew we’d never speak again.  
  
We wore our usual faces  
The last time we spoke  
Knowing what those masks blanked  
How much our hearts broke.  
  
I miss you dad  
Just as I knew I would  
But hid to spare you pain  
Hear me now! I wish you could.  
  
Decades pass  
Sat here alone I sob  
And set aside my mask —  
For all your happy birthdays lost.
