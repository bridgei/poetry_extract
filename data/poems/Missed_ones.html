<h1>Missed ones</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Sometimes the simplest things set us off on a bend </p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>The hoot of an owl deep in the wood<br />
Tugs at a chord that rings a bell<br />
That stirs a memory</p><br />
<br />
A simple conversation<br />
That breaks my heart</p><br />
<br />
This walk in the park <br />
Now thankfully dark <br />
Turned tearful under frosty stars.</p><br />
<br />
