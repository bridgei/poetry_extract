<h1>From the park walk today …</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>The past few days’ storms brought almost constant rain. Now, after the dawn’s drizzle, the sun is shining. I set off following the dog onto the familiar path through the local park land. </p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Already I can see damage to more than a few trees, even some fallen ones. Ahead a young beech tree has succumbed to the weight of the rains. Broken, it lies across the path. A fledgling blackbird sits on the gravel amidst broken branches, basking in a pool of morning sunlight. We walk around, dog and I.</p><br />
<br />
Felled tree<br />
Roosting spot no more —<br />
Only rain</p><br />
<br />
Meadow grass<br />
White clover sprinkles<br />
Dew glistens</p><br />
<br />
Woodland glade’s sunbeams<br />
Hopping blackbird stops, listens —<br />
Raindrops pattering</p><br />
<br />
</p><br />
<br />
</p><br />
<br />
