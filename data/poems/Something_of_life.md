# Something of life  
> 

Adrift we seem  
We are boats on the ocean  
Leaves in the wind  
Soot in the flames  
The dance we think we dance  
That dance  
That dance is the dance of existence   
Its vibrant pulsing chaos animates us  
And we dance the best we can  
Until exhausted   
Extinguished  
We return once more  
To the core  
To the heart  
To existence
