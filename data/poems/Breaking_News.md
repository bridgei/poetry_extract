# Breaking News …  
> ews … Breaking News … Breaking N …  
> I remember when news didn’t break; it flashed. Came and went. Now it lingers long. Like a lodger.  
> Manufacturing news for profit is sooper sleazy; it’s all gonna end in tears.  

I recall  
When the world wasn’t so small.  
When news was fresh;  
Now it’s   
Mined and processed   
And pressed  
Down gullets.  
An unavoidable slurry  
Of worry.  
  
I recall  
When I’d no idea  
Misery was roaming streets  
In towns in places   
I didn’t know either.  
Now it’s   
Like doom is just  
A news-cycle away  
Maybe it’s our place today.  
  
I recall  
When news wasn’t commodity  
Something dug-up  
Shaped  
Slanted and pointed  
Used to divide  
To provide  
Profit from misery   
Titillation from drudgery.  
  
I recall  
When news didn’t sell  
Like hot cakes from hell  
Now this designer drug  
Is crafted and honed  
To our negativity-bone  
Make it stop; turn it off  
Breaking News music tolling   
Don’t look Ethel … the ticker’s rolling!
