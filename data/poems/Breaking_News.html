<h1>Breaking News …</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>ews … Breaking News … Breaking N …</p><br />
<p>I remember when news didn’t break; it flashed. Came and went. Now it lingers long. Like a lodger.</p><br />
<p>Manufacturing news for profit is sooper sleazy; it’s all gonna end in tears.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>I recall<br />
When the world wasn’t so small.<br />
When news was fresh;<br />
Now it’s <br />
Mined and processed <br />
And pressed<br />
Down gullets.<br />
An unavoidable slurry<br />
Of worry.</p><br />
<br />
I recall<br />
When I’d no idea<br />
Misery was roaming streets<br />
In towns in places <br />
I didn’t know either.<br />
Now it’s <br />
Like doom is just<br />
A news-cycle away<br />
Maybe it’s our place today.</p><br />
<br />
I recall<br />
When news wasn’t commodity<br />
Something dug-up<br />
Shaped<br />
Slanted and pointed<br />
Used to divide<br />
To provide<br />
Profit from misery <br />
Titillation from drudgery.</p><br />
<br />
I recall<br />
When news didn’t sell<br />
Like hot cakes from hell<br />
Now this designer drug<br />
Is crafted and honed<br />
To our negativity-bone<br />
Make it stop; turn it off<br />
Breaking News music tolling <br />
Don’t look Ethel … the ticker’s rolling!</p><br />
<br />
