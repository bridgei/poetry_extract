# w3-prompt-55-acrostic-meditation  
> See prompt posted here ( https://skepticskaddish.com/2023/05/17/w3-prompt-55-weave-written-weekly/ )  
In response to the prompt to write an acrostic —I had to look it up too— verse based on one of these words: Discipline; Enthusiasm; Meditation; Tumult; Trouble.  


Meditation acrostic  
  
Mind runs on ahead  
Eager to greet new experience  
Determined to find meaning  
Intent on solving the mystery.  
Troubled it turns inward  
Anxiously replaying, rewriting, editing.  
The body is.  
In time mind tires, falls still.  
Only awareness flitters.  
Now breath comes, now breath goes.
