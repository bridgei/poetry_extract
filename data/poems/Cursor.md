# Cursor …  
> On just being, or on becoming invisible … ?  


I am the space 'twixt  
You and the shadow on the wall -   
Creeping slowly by.  
  
I am that gap 'twixt  
Your every thought and action  
Unnoticed, unknowable.  
  
I am the breath   
In each and every sigh  
Cast adrift to cry.  
  
I am the stranger  
Who looks the other way -  
Lonely passenger.  
  
I remain forever  
The chance encounter stillborn -   
Scared of the moment.  
  
My life  
A blinking cursor -  
A pregnant pause
