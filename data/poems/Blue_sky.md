# Blue sky  
> Sit and watch the morning begin sometime; watch it like your first ever morning, your final day break.  


Autumnal blue sky  
Kissing the Pennine moors  
Raising morning’s mists.Swirling mist condensing  
Cooling on smoke stained buttermilk stone  
On the pock marked mill house wall.  
Dripping down out-house  windows  
Silvering the spider webs.September sun  
Rousing  the dormant mouser  
Stalking the allotment patch  
Striking the dormouse   
An early morning catch.
