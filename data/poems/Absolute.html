<h1>Absolute</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>So I came across a writing challenge to write a poem or a piece of prose in exactly 80 words using the word “Absolute” or a derivative of it. https://sammiscribbles.wordpress.com/2023/05/13/weekend-writing-prompt-311-absolute/</p><br />
<p>Cold enough to freeze the screaming silence  Between stars; between hearts once locked in orbit. </p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Absolute zero<br />
Is the temperature of space. <br />
Cold enough to freeze the screaming silence <br />
Between stars; between hearts once locked in orbit. <br />
It holds the aching gouts of pain <br />
That wrack the souls of survivors <br />
Left behind by those departed. <br />
Icy as the chasm between life and death <br />
It marks the line we cannot uncross; <br />
The curtain from which none return. Absolute silence<br />
Is the sound of a universe bereft of awareness; <br />
The patter of frozen tears at mans’ demise. . </p><br />
<br />
