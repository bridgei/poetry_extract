# Self transformation — steps on a path  
> Meditation isn’t all peace and bliss. Sometimes there is only this …   


Today Mr Irritated came by; taking over mind.  
He moved in wholesale. His sort often do.   
His rage announced his arrival.  
Unbeckoned, unneeded, unwanted.  
  
Its not me. I don’t know where it comes from.  
He just barges into mind —tense and bristly.   
We fight always —he and I— I want him gone.  
Who needs the anger the shouting? No one.  
  
Today, I said “Just sit”.  
“You’re welcome here.  
“Have this chair by the fire.  
“It’s yours when you need it.  
  
“I don’t know who you are  
“Or why you come on by here  
“Why you’re irritated  
“Or what you want with me  
  
“It doesn’t matter  
“I’m busy with this-ness just now  
“But I’ll only be downstairs.  
“Rest; I’ll check in soon”.  
  
And leaving irritation resting there  
Down into heart I went; off about my day.  
Just me and my dog and this-ness.  
Checking back on Mr. Irritated when I could  
  
And so it was I found him  
Slumped and snoozing there   
I’m sure I heard him mumbling-low  
“I’m sorry … I’ve just nowhere else to go”.
