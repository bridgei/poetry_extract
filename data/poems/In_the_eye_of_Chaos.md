# In the eye of Chaos  
> How does it feel to sit in the midst of a mental maelstrom?  


Stillness rarely falls  
In this turbulent storm  
I snatch at passing squalls  
Deciphering their truculent form  
Teasing out their words  
In whispers barely heard.Silence rarely falls.  
In this incessant gale  
I grasp at half-heard calls;  
Rendering their stinging tale  
Teasing out their words  
In whispers barely heard.Joy barely registers  
In this tempest keening   
I cling to swirling non sequiturs  
Devining their twisted meaning   
Teasing out their words  
In whispers barely heard.In the eye of the storm is calm;  
The still silent howl of despair,  
And I yet waiting there.
