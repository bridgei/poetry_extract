# Awareness …  
> Awareness is a wonderful thing. It comes. It goes. Welcome it as an old friend sometime. Get to know it.  

Where —inside— is awareness?  
Does it cry and rage and prey  
Somewhere within our head?  
Or hide itself away  
Deep in our chest instead?  
  
Where —inside— is awareness?  
Does it mull and fret and rail  
Somewhere within our mind?  
Or secretly prevail,  
Somewhere we may never find?  
  
Where —inside— is awareness?  
Mind has it by the tail,  
And grapples with it still.  
Let it go —to swoop and soar—  
Boundless, deep within our heart .  
  
Where now is awareness?   
Free, it sits and settles,  
Like a basking butterfly.  
It rests within us and without us.  
Let it be and enjoy the ride.
