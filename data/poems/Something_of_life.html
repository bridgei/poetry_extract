<h1>Something of life</h1><br />
<blockquote></blockquote>

</p>Adrift we seem<br />
We are boats on the ocean<br />
Leaves in the wind<br />
Soot in the flames<br />
The dance we think we dance<br />
That dance<br />
That dance is the dance of existence <br />
Its vibrant pulsing chaos animates us<br />
And we dance the best we can<br />
Until exhausted <br />
Extinguished<br />
We return once more<br />
To the core<br />
To the heart<br />
To existence</p><br />
<br />
<br />
