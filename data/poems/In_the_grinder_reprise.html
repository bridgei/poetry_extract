<h1>In the grinder (reprise)</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>In which the serpent eats its own tail.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>So knowing, yet unknowing <br />
How is it I sense<br />
This part of me<br />
So lonely and unloved<br />
That it believes;<br />
That it pens, this verse:—<br />
I was meant to be a hermit<br />
Solitary; shunned-and-shunning strife<br />
Living where I could<br />
Wandering where I would<br />
Instincitvely dodging life<br />
The abrasive rawness of … it.<br />
—This verse tears at me; Binds <br />
Fetters me by the haunches<br />
For in the midst of that turmoil<br />
Arises no peace<br />
No love<br />
Negation of tranquility<br />
It consumes all<br />
Humbles the seeker <br />
Scrabbling at the cliff face<br />
Fall is arrested<br />
Briefly there is knowing <br />
The knower is not that<br />
Then the fall rejoined <br />
The seeker despairs<br />
Forgetting <br />
Believing the narrative<br />
Turning pages <br />
Heading for grey night<br />
Unfurled hopes in tatters<br />
Foetal</p><br />
<br />
What is it thought it had progressed;<br />
Was on the path;<br />
Was grounding?<br />
Chimera!<br />
I was a shadow <br />
Chasing a dream<br />
Believing this ego’s lies<br />
Shells within writhing shells<br />
Of false hoods and delusion<br />
Spun to mollify, distract<br />
A dagger to spirit<br />
Fatal</p><br />
<br />
Hitting the bottom<br />
I was shaken<br />
Yet not awakened<br />
There is yet so very far to go<br />
And no one to make the trip. </p><br />
<br />
