<h1>Awareness …</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Awareness is a wonderful thing. It comes. It goes. Welcome it as an old friend sometime. Get to know it.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Where —inside— is awareness?<br />
Does it cry and rage and prey<br />
Somewhere within our head?<br />
Or hide itself away<br />
Deep in our chest instead?</p><br />
<br />
Where —inside— is awareness?<br />
Does it mull and fret and rail<br />
Somewhere within our mind?<br />
Or secretly prevail,<br />
Somewhere we may never find?</p><br />
<br />
Where —inside— is awareness?<br />
Mind has it by the tail,<br />
And grapples with it still.<br />
Let it go —to swoop and soar—<br />
Boundless, deep within our heart .</p><br />
<br />
Where now is awareness? <br />
Free, it sits and settles,<br />
Like a basking butterfly.<br />
It rests within us and without us.<br />
Let it be and enjoy the ride.</p><br />
<br />
