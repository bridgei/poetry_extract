# Now waning, now waxing  
> Just a note from a short midwinter stroll.  
Darkness reigns  
Shrouds this dawn walk  
Crisp crescent moon  
Accompanies this bright morning star  
Startled Robinâ€™s song  
Splits this stillness  
  
Frost rimed holly leaves  
Glossy on this tree  
The crunch of frosted leaves  
Beneath these feet  
The caw of that distant crow  
These things lift this heart  
  
This everchanging journey   
Its uncertain path fraught   
Resolves in each such moment  
As peace, joy and love  
Only be here  
And this you will know
