# Smiley bin  
> I seem to see that, for an open mind, there is a beauty everywhere.  
Sunlight on the grit salt bin  
Bouncing yellow gold.  
Unseen amidst commuter rush  
Sunbeams scatter, joyful.  
  
A vibrant fountain,  
A beacon to melt the miseryÂ   
Of the closed heart,  
Of the hard mind.  
  
A lever to open eyes  
To prise  
Warmth  
From unwitting bitter coldness.
