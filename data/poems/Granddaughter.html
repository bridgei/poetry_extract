<h1>Granddaughter</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Somethings in life are so beautiful, so precious, so damn joyous, that they come out the other side as agonisingly painful. Or maybe that’s just me. I cry.</p><br />

</p>Granddaughter</p><br />
<br />
You light my life <br />
Your laugh your smile <br />
Hugs at night and anytime<br />
There was a time I felt<br />
That I’d loved all I would<br />
But now I know that sweetest joy<br />
Of finding your long lost toy<br />
Asleep inside my old shoe<br />
You lovely rascal you.</p><br />
<br />
It breaks my heart this life<br />
Sadness stalks each sweet moment<br />
Your innocence runs before you<br />
Across the playground shrieking in glee<br />
Friends in all directions flee<br />
Hiding now in joyful play<br />
My heart yearns for it to stay this way<br />
For your life to be an endless rainbow<br />
A miasmic blur of unicorns and fairy tales<br />
Yet I know<br />
It cannot be so</p><br />
<br />
Into your life pain will creep<br />
Just as it does with each of us<br />
Scarring often far to deep<br />
Leaving us wishing for how it was<br />
And ever it will be so<br />
Sadness stalking from the shadows<br />
Even now as evening draws<br />
Sadness sits with me and jaws<br />
That one day I will not be<br />
The one to pick you up and rub your knee</p><br />
<br />
Even this love I feel cuts so sharp<br />
It dawns on me now that sometime <br />
As we walk our paths must diverge<br />
There will be a time my child<br />
When I cannot walk with you <br />
Nor run nor push your swing<br />
Nor whizz you down life’s slide<br />
This sadness sits sipping tea<br />
It is a lovely thing<br />
The shadow side of loving deep<br />
The laughter that comes before the sleep</p><br />
<br />
