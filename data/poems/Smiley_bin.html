<h1>Smiley bin</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>I seem to see that, for an open mind, there is a beauty everywhere.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Sunlight on the grit salt bin<br />
Bouncing yellow gold.<br />
Unseen amidst commuter rush<br />
Sunbeams scatter, joyful.</p><br />
<br />
A vibrant fountain,<br />
A beacon to melt the miseryÂ <br />
Of the closed heart,<br />
Of the hard mind.</p><br />
<br />
A lever to open eyes<br />
To prise<br />
Warmth<br />
From unwitting bitter coldness.</p><br />
<br />
