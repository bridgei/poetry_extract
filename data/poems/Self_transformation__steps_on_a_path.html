<h1>Self transformation — steps on a path</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Meditation isn’t all peace and bliss. Sometimes there is only this … </p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Today Mr Irritated came by; taking over mind.<br />
He moved in wholesale. His sort often do. <br />
His rage announced his arrival.<br />
Unbeckoned, unneeded, unwanted.</p><br />
<br />
Its not me. I don’t know where it comes from.<br />
He just barges into mind —tense and bristly. <br />
We fight always —he and I— I want him gone.<br />
Who needs the anger the shouting? No one.</p><br />
<br />
Today, I said “Just sit”.<br />
“You’re welcome here.<br />
“Have this chair by the fire.<br />
“It’s yours when you need it.</p><br />
<br />
“I don’t know who you are<br />
“Or why you come on by here<br />
“Why you’re irritated<br />
“Or what you want with me</p><br />
<br />
“It doesn’t matter<br />
“I’m busy with this-ness just now<br />
“But I’ll only be downstairs.<br />
“Rest; I’ll check in soon”.</p><br />
<br />
And leaving irritation resting there<br />
Down into heart I went; off about my day.<br />
Just me and my dog and this-ness.<br />
Checking back on Mr. Irritated when I could</p><br />
<br />
And so it was I found him<br />
Slumped and snoozing there <br />
I’m sure I heard him mumbling-low<br />
“I’m sorry … I’ve just nowhere else to go”. </p><br />
<br />
