# Absolute  
> So I came across a writing challenge to write a poem or a piece of prose in exactly 80 words using the word “Absolute” or a derivative of it. https://sammiscribbles.wordpress.com/2023/05/13/weekend-writing-prompt-311-absolute/  
Cold enough to freeze the screaming silence  Between stars; between hearts once locked in orbit.   


Absolute zero  
Is the temperature of space.   
Cold enough to freeze the screaming silence   
Between stars; between hearts once locked in orbit.   
It holds the aching gouts of pain   
That wrack the souls of survivors   
Left behind by those departed.   
Icy as the chasm between life and death   
It marks the line we cannot uncross;   
The curtain from which none return. Absolute silence  
Is the sound of a universe bereft of awareness;   
The patter of frozen tears at mans’ demise. .
