# The colour of hope  
> Sometimes a muse just comes in the post …  

Hope is a snowdrop nosing through grit  
White tipped greenness,  
Stained with the earthen truth of it.  
  
If hope had a colour  
It would be a rainbow’s hue;   
Fused as a singularity.  
  
If hope had a colour   
It would be justly true;  
Mitigating life’s duality.  
  
Hope is the colour of you.
