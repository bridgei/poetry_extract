# Morning sit  

Morning sitting  
Not so much meditation  
As a rummage in the closet.  
I might need that.  
No I won’t use this again.  
Ooo — I can’t let that go.  
  
Seems someone packed away little pieces  
Of stark real reality  
Into zip-wraps —words—  
Then stuffed ‘em in a shoebox —conceptualised—  
I found them now, stashed away in here  
Half-forgotten memories fading in this closet.  
  
I sat with some of them  
They were stale and void  
Reality moves on  
Existence passes  
This closet is a graveyard  
Why do I carry it around?  
  
In this moment is birdsong  
Cool air around my toes  
The swelling murmur of the morning commute outside  
The spectacles on my nose  
A tickle in my throat  
Raw mundanity abounds.
