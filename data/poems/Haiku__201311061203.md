Baker Street  
dirty boots shuffling  
- mind the gap!Big issue  
Pale streetseller’s bark -  
Empty handHaunted eyes  
Flared nostrils wide hips  
Gypsy bloodTaxi! Hand raised.  
Diesel-smoke choking  
She is gone.That brief glance -  
Our darting eyes locked;  
Connection.Siren’s call  
Blue lights streaking-by.  
Emergency.My running  
Heart pounding mind whirling  
Chasing hope
