<h1>Mysterious prompts</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Then … to make it harder … I tried it as an Elfchen —</p><br />
<p>Prompted by a challenge to write a poem that includes the word ‘mystery‘. https://ladyjabberwocky.com/2023/05/15/prompt-of-the-week-mystery-and-wonder/ I somehow was reminded of samsara (weird, my mind is)</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Mystery<br />
Great unknown<br />
Senses’ subconsciously seduced<br />
Self’s sublime search stalls —<br />
Rebirth <br />
</p><br />
<br />
