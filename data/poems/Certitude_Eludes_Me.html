<h1>Certitude Eludes Me</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>I sometimes think they are from a very different universe to me.</p><br />
<p>We are blessed to live close to a Temple of the Church of Latter Day Saints. I meet such lovely people from exotic places as my dog and I take our walk.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>It was just last week they stopped me.<br />
Two girls from far far away.<br />
Flashing Latter Day Saints cards <br />
With Latter Day Saints smiles.<br />
What would I ask god they <br />
Seemed to want to know.</p><br />
<br />
God? He left this place a long time ago<br />
Grabbed his coat and a hackney cab<br />
Did a moonlit flit to the costa<br />
I hear santa and he get on fine.<br />
The LDS girls couldn’t follow this nihilistic path<br />
And I didn’t have the heart to disabuse them.</p><br />
<br />
Our spiritual paths remain divergent<br />
I don’t envy their certitude.<br />
Though it’d be such a comfort <br />
On cold British mornings (all of them yes)<br />
When me, myself and I<br />
Sit to face the turmoil within.</p><br />
<br />
Reality is a threadbare meditation<br />
On living right and helping others<br />
On being better today <br />
Than yesterday<br />
On doing the dishes<br />
And cooking the rice</p><br />
<br />
If I ever find inner peace <br />
For more than fleeting moments<br />
Maybe I’d flash their cherub smile too.<br />
If there was a creator god father-nanny<br />
The question I think I’d ask …<br />
“What were you thinking?!”.</p><br />
<br />
