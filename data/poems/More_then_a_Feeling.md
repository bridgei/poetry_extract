# More then a Feeling  
> Love is not a feeling….  
Marie Howe (After the Movie)  
This poem is inspired by a line in a Marie Howe poem titled After the Movie  


What if love was just a feeling?  
Just a little emotion to brighten the night.  
What if love was just a feeling?  
But it’s more than that —you know that; right?  
  
If love was just a feeling  
You could up and walk away.  
If love was just a feeling  
What would there be … to make you stay?  
  
But, what-if love was just a feeling …  
When you’d been and had your way  
When that feeling waned and ebbed inside  
Would you leave, or would you stay?  
  
How could love be just a feeling?  
When it burns inside so fierce.  
When its light puts solitude to flight  
And universe touches universe.  
  
So no, love is not a feeling.  
Love … is an imperative!  
An innate compulsion;  
To sustain, to thrive.  
  
Love is a life-force;  
Strong as the will-to-live.  
Shareable, transferable;   
It is the gift we cannot not give.  
  
Love is the bridge  
Spanning minds, profound connection.  
Transforming, inspiring;  
Singularity’s completion.  
  
Love is.  
JFDI!
