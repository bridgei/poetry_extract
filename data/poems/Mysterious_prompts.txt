Mysterious prompts
Then … to make it harder … I tried it as an Elfchen —
Prompted by a challenge to write a poem that includes the word ‘mystery‘. https://ladyjabberwocky.com/2023/05/15/prompt-of-the-week-mystery-and-wonder/ I somehow was reminded of samsara (weird, my mind is)


Mystery
Great unknown
Senses’ subconsciously seduced
Self’s sublime search stalls —
Rebirth
