<h1>Morning sit</h1><br />
<blockquote></blockquote>

</p>Morning sitting<br />
Not so much meditation<br />
As a rummage in the closet.<br />
I might need that.<br />
No I won’t use this again.<br />
Ooo — I can’t let that go.</p><br />
<br />
Seems someone packed away little pieces<br />
Of stark real reality<br />
Into zip-wraps —words—<br />
Then stuffed ‘em in a shoebox —conceptualised—<br />
I found them now, stashed away in here<br />
Half-forgotten memories fading in this closet.</p><br />
<br />
I sat with some of them<br />
They were stale and void<br />
Reality moves on<br />
Existence passes<br />
This closet is a graveyard<br />
Why do I carry it around?</p><br />
<br />
In this moment is birdsong<br />
Cool air around my toes<br />
The swelling murmur of the morning commute outside<br />
The spectacles on my nose<br />
A tickle in my throat<br />
Raw mundanity abounds.</p><br />
<br />
