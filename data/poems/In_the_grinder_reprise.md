# In the grinder (reprise)  
> In which the serpent eats its own tail.  


So knowing, yet unknowing   
How is it I sense  
This part of me  
So lonely and unloved  
That it believes;  
That it pens, this verse:—  
I was meant to be a hermit  
Solitary; shunned-and-shunning strife  
Living where I could  
Wandering where I would  
Instincitvely dodging life  
The abrasive rawness of … it.  
—This verse tears at me; Binds   
Fetters me by the haunches  
For in the midst of that turmoil  
Arises no peace  
No love  
Negation of tranquility  
It consumes all  
Humbles the seeker   
Scrabbling at the cliff face  
Fall is arrested  
Briefly there is knowing   
The knower is not that  
Then the fall rejoined   
The seeker despairs  
Forgetting   
Believing the narrative  
Turning pages   
Heading for grey night  
Unfurled hopes in tatters  
Foetal  
  
What is it thought it had progressed;  
Was on the path;  
Was grounding?  
Chimera!  
I was a shadow   
Chasing a dream  
Believing this ego’s lies  
Shells within writhing shells  
Of false hoods and delusion  
Spun to mollify, distract  
A dagger to spirit  
Fatal  
  
Hitting the bottom  
I was shaken  
Yet not awakened  
There is yet so very far to go  
And no one to make the trip.
