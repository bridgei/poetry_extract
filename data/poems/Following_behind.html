<h1>Following behind ‚Ä¶</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Every so often a meditation session will present us a jewel. Today for me it excelled. I struggle always with words. I leave this here in gratitude. It is the best [and least] I can do. üôè</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>How is it our body knows more than we do?<br />
Here I am stumbling my way along;<br />
Struggling with lifelong dysthymia. <br />
Sitting with this-ness.<br />
Seemingly seeking the way.</p><br />
<br />
And there up ahead is body beckoning;<br />
Mind ‚Äîperplexed‚Äî is subdued.<br />
Breath-follows-breath, deep inside;<br />
Beyond lungs, deep into the abdomen.<br />
Awareness follows<br />
Like a ferret down a hole<br />
Focus grows.</p><br />
<br />
Here in this woodland clearing <br />
Deep in the forest of this zazen<br />
Is something ineffable.</p><br />
<br />
Unexpected bliss reigns.<br />
Unknown release banishes anxiety, tension.<br />
There is<br />
Just this;<br />
An unbearable lightness of being.</p><br />
<br />
It is gone now leaving <br />
Gratitude and awe <br />
To ripple out into my day</p><br />
<br />
How is it that this body knows the way?<br />
</p><br />
<br />
