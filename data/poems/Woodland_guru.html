<h1>Woodland guru</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Just a walk in the park. A ball a dog an old fool.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>In the woods<br />
My guru trots ahead<br />
All four legs pottering in mindful harmony.</p><br />
<br />
She tests me<br />
Leaves her squeaky toy<br />
Amongst the slender bluebells there.</p><br />
<br />
She hides then<br />
The better to see me<br />
Peeking around the aged oak tree.</p><br />
<br />
In the woods<br />
My guru watches<br />
Mindfully I deploy my ninja skills.</p><br />
<br />
I approach the toy<br />
Slipping between<br />
Fragile fragrant bluebells.<br />
Stepping over <br />
Embryonic trees; <br />
Miniatures, not yet saplings,<br />
They scatter the woodland clearing here.<br />
Tender shoots, basking in the sunlight<br />
Cascading through the canopy gap,<br />
Left by a long passed ancestor,<br />
Remembered now only <br />
By its rotting stump and boughs<br />
A habitat for multitudes.</p><br />
<br />
Bending low<br />
Midst the nettles now<br />
I grasp guru’s squeaky toy; the prize.</p><br />
<br />
I bow to guru —triumphant— only to see<br />
Just a tree; guruless;<br />
She is gone; hiding elsewhere; somewhere.</p><br />
<br />
The lesson continues.<br />
The proto-saplings nod their gratitude<br />
And bluebells smell as bluebells do.<br />
My footsteps leave no trace.<br />
Gassho to the guru, to the woods.</p><br />
<br />
In the woods<br />
My guru trots ahead<br />
All four legs pottering in mindful harmony.</p><br />
<br />
