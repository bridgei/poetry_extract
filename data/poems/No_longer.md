# No longer  
>   
No longer do I sit  
On the old leather La-Z-boy  
No longer listen fondly  
As you prepare dinner in the kitchen  
The comforting sound of cutlery  
Of pots and pans and plates  
No longer drown out the silence  
Now silences sits lingering   
Bracketing pointless moments  
One of us is here   
No longer now  
I forget which of us it is  
No longer does it matter now
