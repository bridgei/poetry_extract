<h1>Old Memories …</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>It’s been quiet in the park today</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>It's been quiet in the park today<br />
Little to harsh the grass's sway<br />
In the softest autumn breeze<br />
Little to mask mind's endless tease<br />
Of Septembers long turned to dust</p><br />
<br />
It's been quiet in the park today<br />
Only memories out to play<br />
</p><br />
<br />
