Fallen friends …


They stand majestic
In the midst of the field
These two old birch trees
Lifelong companions both.

Together they reach for the sky
The gap in their canopy 
Tenderly embracing still
The form of their fallen friend.

Long gone now
The middle birch’s shape 
Still echoes; crying out to those who see
The gap in the canopy.
