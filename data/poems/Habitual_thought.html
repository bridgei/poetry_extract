<h1>Habitual thought</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Image credit: Noah Buscher @ Unsplash</p><br />
<p>My response to image posted by Sadje in this post: https://lifeafter50forwomen.com/2023/04/24/what-do-you-see-183/</p><br />
<p>Sometime things aren’t what they may seem; certainly they are not always what mind tells us they are.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>Reaching up I see you<br />
Trapped upon life’s edge<br />
Anchored in mundanity.<br />
I try to coax you down here<br />
To awaken to the freedom of reality.<br />
I see you looking down in fear<br />
Hand reaching down to mine<br />
Longing —yet unable—<br />
To take that final step<br />
Beyond doubt<br />
Into the uncertainty of existence.<br />
</p><br />
