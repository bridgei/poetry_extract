<h1>Fallen friends …</h1><br />
<blockquote></blockquote>

</p>They stand majestic<br />
In the midst of the field<br />
These two old birch trees<br />
Lifelong companions both.</p><br />
<br />
Together they reach for the sky<br />
The gap in their canopy <br />
Tenderly embracing still<br />
The form of their fallen friend.</p><br />
<br />
Long gone now<br />
The middle birch’s shape <br />
Still echoes; crying out to those who see<br />
The gap in the canopy.</p><br />
<br />
