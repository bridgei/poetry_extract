> Challenging perspective â€¦  

the ironic tragedy of time travel is not that it is unattainable;  
rather that it is unavoidable.  
  
as from a train pulling slowly from the station,  
we sit powerless and transfixed;  
gazing through smeared windows  
watching all that we knew dwindle into insigniificance
