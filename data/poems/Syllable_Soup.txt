Syllable Soup  â€¦

Sometimes we need to set aside words and touch that which is real; with all our senses. No labels, no lies, no incompleteness. Just what is..
Syllables fall, softly settling
As does snow on an old oak tree
Smothering all beneath them
Blanketing beauty
Masking misery
Distorting and distracting

Words form paragraphs join chapters
New worlds are born
Coalescing from the morass
A new reality
Bigger better bolder brasher
Buy it, read it, see it, watch it; upgrade it

Beneath it all lies what is
The mother and father of all words
That which needs no words
Such is this existence
Wordless it is real
Eternal Suchness
