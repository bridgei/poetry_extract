<h1>Renga 20000222-0932</h1><br />
<blockquote></blockquote>

</p>beautiful chester<br />
walled city<br />
layered historyfrom the walls I look down<br />
on neat homes in cobbled mewsbehind me<br />
the branches<br />
of ancient treescome alive with the twilight<br />
and the calling of roosting birdsthe cathedral<br />
stands majestic and aloof<br />
in the gathering gloomsullen silence seeps from abbey walls<br />
tendrils snaking on cool night airby King Charles tower<br />
brush bold and tender branches -<br />
budding in early springnew life springing in yellow<br />
from the dead summer gonearound me<br />
the sights and the sounds<br />
of a city going homedog-walking families<br />
and the scent of home cookingexcited children<br />
race ahead<br />
oblivious yet absorbedyoungest chasing the footsteps<br />
of his elder brother's patheye-gazing lovers<br />
stroll behind<br />
absorbed yet obliviousbright starlight twinkles<br />
in their universe withinso many worlds<br />
within this one world<br />
mind games in layerspieces in the box; dice roll -<br />
counters move, lives fall â€¦.</p><br />
