<h1>Woodland mood</h1><br />
<blockquote></blockquote>

</p>This woodland walk <br />
Its sleepy rhythm<br />
Paced by sunbeams<br />
Lapping against the trunks <br />
Of gently passing trees</p><br />
<br />
Dappled shade punctuates<br />
Emphasising this tree or that <br />
Indifferent and ever-changing<br />
Just as mind —seeking action— <br />
Endlessly purveys baseless thoughts</p><br />
<br />
The sound of the breeze in the canopy  <br />
A reminder always<br />
Of that whisper of silence<br />
That pervades all<br />
Soothing this troubled heart</p><br />
<br />
<br />
