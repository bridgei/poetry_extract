# Following behind ‚Ä¶  
> Every so often a meditation session will present us a jewel. Today for me it excelled. I struggle always with words. I leave this here in gratitude. It is the best [and least] I can do. üôè  
How is it our body knows more than we do?  
Here I am stumbling my way along;  
Struggling with lifelong dysthymia.   
Sitting with this-ness.  
Seemingly seeking the way.  
  
And there up ahead is body beckoning;  
Mind ‚Äîperplexed‚Äî is subdued.  
Breath-follows-breath, deep inside;  
Beyond lungs, deep into the abdomen.  
Awareness follows  
Like a ferret down a hole  
Focus grows.  
  
Here in this woodland clearing   
Deep in the forest of this zazen  
Is something ineffable.  
  
Unexpected bliss reigns.  
Unknown release banishes anxiety, tension.  
There is  
Just this;  
An unbearable lightness of being.  
  
It is gone now leaving   
Gratitude and awe   
To ripple out into my day  
  
How is it that this body knows the way?
