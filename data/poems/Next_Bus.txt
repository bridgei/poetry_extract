Next Bus …
> Don’t hang around. This bus might be the best bus you’ll ever see. Not perfect, just the best bus you see.

The rain drips 
Bus pulls in
Queue presses me forward.

What if I wait?
Get the next bus
There’s no free seat;
Such a crush.

What if I wait,
It’s almost due
There’ll be a seat;
It’ll be on time too.

The rain drips
Bus pulls out
Queue leaves me standing

What if I wait?
It’s well past due
This next bus
Could be full too.

The rain drips
Bus no shows
Queue shuffles me along

What if I wait?
I could be gone 
That last bus
May have been the one.

The rain drips
Bus passes by
Queue spits me out.

What if I wait?
