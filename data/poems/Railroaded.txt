Railroaded

Sitting in the garden. I’m surrounded not by the usual sound of nature; thrush, robins and blackbird song. No today it is the sound of chain saw and shredder as contractors clear the green corridor that was. They need to shore-up the railroad’s cutting.
Coming for the trees

 Today sadness settled in
Today they came for the trees
They came with chainsaws and shredders
With good intentions; environmental measures
Good workers, with families and babies to feed
Corporations with plans and projects and pressures
Lawyers, liabilities and profit and greed

They came for the trees
So the trains could run
So the houses don’t slip 
Down into the dip; the cutting they built..
I felt the screams inside
They bit me deep; so I cried; 
Perhaps its love … or is it guilt?

The hawthorn, blackthorn and maple and hornbeam
I planted them all; that whole hedgerow 
A thirty-metre strip, where life could just sit.
A squirrel highway
Birds love(d) it; raise(d) chicks in it
Today is a sad day
Today they came for the trees
