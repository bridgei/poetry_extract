Certitude Eludes Me

I sometimes think they are from a very different universe to me.

We are blessed to live close to a Temple of the Church of Latter Day Saints. I meet such lovely people from exotic places as my dog and I take our walk.
It was just last week they stopped me.
Two girls from far far away.
Flashing Latter Day Saints cards 
With Latter Day Saints smiles.
What would I ask god they 
Seemed to want to know.

God? He left this place a long time ago
Grabbed his coat and a hackney cab
Did a moonlit flit to the costa
I hear santa and he get on fine.
The LDS girls couldn’t follow this nihilistic path
And I didn’t have the heart to disabuse them.

Our spiritual paths remain divergent
I don’t envy their certitude.
Though it’d be such a comfort 
On cold British mornings (all of them yes)
When me, myself and I
Sit to face the turmoil within.

Reality is a threadbare meditation
On living right and helping others
On being better today 
Than yesterday
On doing the dishes
And cooking the rice

If I ever find inner peace 
For more than fleeting moments
Maybe I’d flash their cherub smile too.
If there was a creator god father-nanny
The question I think I’d ask …
“What were you thinking?!”.
