Midwinter
> Memory is the cruelest master; flee it, shun it, disown it.

December
Bleakest of months
Dark and cold
Stark and unforgiving
Turning cold light
Onto the loneliest of hearts
Raising ghosts
Of memories 
Raking glass
Across scabbed scars
You haunt me
Chasing through my dreams
Stirring emotions buried 
Beneath the dust of loved ones
Of gatherings long lost
And times to be no moreDecember
Be gone
Your biting winds
Eat at my soul
Feasting on sorrow
Distilled from loves gone by
From fleeting touches
And regrets doleful stareDecember
I remember
The joy you once wrought 
It is a husk now. 
 Stone cold.
 Irredeemable.
