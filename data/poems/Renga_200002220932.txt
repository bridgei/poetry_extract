beautiful chester
walled city
layered historyfrom the walls I look down
on neat homes in cobbled mewsbehind me
the branches
of ancient treescome alive with the twilight
and the calling of roosting birdsthe cathedral
stands majestic and aloof
in the gathering gloomsullen silence seeps from abbey walls
tendrils snaking on cool night airby King Charles tower
brush bold and tender branches -
budding in early springnew life springing in yellow
from the dead summer gonearound me
the sights and the sounds
of a city going homedog-walking families
and the scent of home cookingexcited children
race ahead
oblivious yet absorbedyoungest chasing the footsteps
of his elder brother's patheye-gazing lovers
stroll behind
absorbed yet obliviousbright starlight twinkles
in their universe withinso many worlds
within this one world
mind games in layerspieces in the box; dice roll -
counters move, lives fall â€¦.
