<h1>Midwinter</h1><br />
<blockquote><p>Memory is the cruelest master; flee it, shun it, disown it.</p><br />
</blockquote>

</p>December<br />
Bleakest of months<br />
Dark and cold<br />
Stark and unforgiving<br />
Turning cold light<br />
Onto the loneliest of hearts<br />
Raising ghosts<br />
Of memories <br />
Raking glass<br />
Across scabbed scars<br />
You haunt me<br />
Chasing through my dreams<br />
Stirring emotions buried <br />
Beneath the dust of loved ones<br />
Of gatherings long lost<br />
And times to be no moreDecember<br />
Be gone<br />
Your biting winds<br />
Eat at my soul<br />
Feasting on sorrow<br />
Distilled from loves gone by<br />
From fleeting touches<br />
And regrets doleful stareDecember<br />
I remember<br />
The joy you once wrought <br />
It is a husk now. <br />
 Stone cold.<br />
 Irredeemable.</p><br />
<br />
