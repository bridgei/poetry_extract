<h1>No longer</h1><br />
<blockquote></blockquote>

</p>No longer do I sit<br />
On the old leather La-Z-boy<br />
No longer listen fondly<br />
As you prepare dinner in the kitchen<br />
The comforting sound of cutlery<br />
Of pots and pans and plates<br />
No longer drown out the silence<br />
Now silences sits lingering <br />
Bracketing pointless moments<br />
One of us is here <br />
No longer now<br />
I forget which of us it is<br />
No longer does it matter now</p><br />
<br />
