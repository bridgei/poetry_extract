Placeholder for Compassion
> Words are pale imitations of experience; of suchness. Do not be fooled by relying upon them.

My words are empty.
They leave you suffering,
Though I am here.
Words, a poor substitute,
A proxy compassion;
For my leaving you.
For my wandering this land
Seeking berries and herbs.
Returning to you always;
Tending your wounds, with natureâ€™s salves.

My words are empty.
They leave me suffering,
Now you are gone.
Words, a pale imitation,
A proxy remorse;
For my leaving you.
For my wandering this mind
Seeking truths and justices.
Returning to you briefly;
Tending your wounds with empty concepts.
