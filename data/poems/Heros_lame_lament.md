# Hero’s lame lament  
> 

I was supposed to fix things here; to change the world.  
That’s something I remember.   
But I can’t recall how.  
I was going to make things better here for everyone; more equitable, peaceful.   
What was it I was supposed to do?   
  
If only I could remember now.  
The dreams I had —when I was younger— they pointed the way.   
I was going into space;  explore Mars —then the stars;   
Discover a cure for the incurable;   
Be the catalyst for a movement that shaped a just world.   
  
Where did those dreams go?  
When did they fade away?  
I must have put them down somewhere on this path; but where and why?  
It’s too late now to go back and find them.  
I fear the fading light will beat me.  
  
What was I thinking?  
I thought there was so much time —  
But it’s nearly all gone now.  
How? I just looked away —distracted maybe—  
But just for a moment I swear.  
  
I was supposed to fix things here;to change the world.   
But I forgot those dreams;  
Lost my way  
What’ll they do when I get back home!?  
Oh … then there’ll be hell to pay!
