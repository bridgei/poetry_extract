# Singularity, serenity, sundered!  
> With a nod to Buddha and Darryl Reanney â€” from stardust of a singularity we are born; quantum entanglement binds us.  


I remember singularity  
We were one, complete  
You and I and them  
  
I recall serenity  
We were calm, content  
You and I and them  
  
I recollect separation  
We were rent, sundered  
You and I and them  
  
I realise sorrow  
We were many, apart  
You and I and them  
  
I endure separation  
We were split, adrift  
You and I and them.  
  
I suffer solitude  
We are lost, seeking  
You for I for them.  
  
Singularity, serenity, sundered!  
We grope still in darkness  
You for I for them
