<h1>Hero’s lame lament</h1><br />
<blockquote></blockquote>

</p>I was supposed to fix things here; to change the world.<br />
That’s something I remember. <br />
But I can’t recall how.<br />
I was going to make things better here for everyone; more equitable, peaceful. <br />
What was it I was supposed to do? </p><br />
<br />
If only I could remember now.<br />
The dreams I had —when I was younger— they pointed the way. <br />
I was going into space;  explore Mars —then the stars; <br />
Discover a cure for the incurable; <br />
Be the catalyst for a movement that shaped a just world. </p><br />
<br />
Where did those dreams go?<br />
When did they fade away?<br />
I must have put them down somewhere on this path; but where and why?<br />
It’s too late now to go back and find them.<br />
I fear the fading light will beat me.</p><br />
<br />
What was I thinking?<br />
I thought there was so much time —<br />
But it’s nearly all gone now.<br />
How? I just looked away —distracted maybe—<br />
But just for a moment I swear.</p><br />
<br />
I was supposed to fix things here;to change the world. <br />
But I forgot those dreams;<br />
Lost my way<br />
What’ll they do when I get back home!?<br />
Oh … then there’ll be hell to pay!<br />
</p><br />
